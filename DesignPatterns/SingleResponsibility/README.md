The idea behind this particular article is to give you some idea of how the Single Reponsibility Principle can be applied to Swift. That is, how it can *actually* be used in real projects with read examples.

Nice, eh?

Difficulty: Beginner | Easy | **Normal** | Challenging<br/>

# Advantages of Single Responsibilities

* Easy to understand functionality
* Efficient modifications and process to build new features
* Limit the number of bugs
* Limit unwanted behaviours (side-effects)
* Astract logic into different classes or modules
* Implementations can be replaced later in the development process
* Unit tests can be defined per class or per module (enabling TDD)
