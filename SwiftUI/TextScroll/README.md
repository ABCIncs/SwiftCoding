Difficulty: **Beginner** | Easy | Normal | Challenging<br/>
This article has been developed using Xcode 11.5, and Swift 5.2.4

# Prerequisites:
* Be able to produce a [“Hello, World!”](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/your-first-swift-application-without-a-mac-79598ad839f8) Swift application
* Be able to produce a ["Hello, World"](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/hello-world-swiftui-92bcf48a62d3) SwiftUI application

# The example
This example is a nice one about how to scroll text up the screen in `SwiftUI` using instance methods on the `Text` struct. 

## That one thing
To find out the height of the device I used `GeometryReader` which is wrapped around the Text view. 

## That's enough!
Let us see the code, let us see the code. Ok: here it is.

# Conclusion
Look, this text scroll does not work perfectly. However, this is an interesting tutorial exploring how to lay out `Text` and change the properties of the text in Swift that can be expanded into your `SwiftUI` projects.

Have fun!
