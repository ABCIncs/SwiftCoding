This article has been developed using Xcode 12.0, and Swift 5.3

## Prerequisites:
* You will be expected to be aware how to make a [Single View Application](https://medium.com/swlh/your-first-ios-application-using-xcode-9983cf6efb71), or a [Playground](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/coding-in-swift-playgrounds-1a5563efa089) to run Swift code

## Terminology:
Snapshot testing: A way to test UI by rendering a UI component, take a snapshot, and then compare it to a reference snapshot file

UBER have [ios-snapshot-test-case](https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case/). At the time of writing, this library does not support Swfit Package Manager - and as I result I used PODS to install this dependency (adding the following in my Podfile)

```swift
  target 'SnapshotTestingTests' do
    inherit! :search_paths
    # Pods for testing
  pod 'iOSSnapshotTestCase'
  end
```

meaning the reader should use `SnapshotTesting.xcworkspace` to open this project, and if you have downloaded the repo you are probably best served by performing a `pod update` in the downloaded/cloned folder.

The following needs to be added to the Run scheme

```
FB_REFERENCE_IMAGE_DIR = $(SOURCE_ROOT)/$(PROJECT_NAME)Tests/ReferenceImages
IMAGE_DIFF_DIR = $(SOURCE_ROOT)/$(PROJECT_NAME)Tests/FailureDiffs
```

So we get there by going to Project>Edit scheme

Then clicking `Run` 
The clicking `Arguments`
Then click the + under Environment Variables

![resultscheme.png](Images/resultscheme.png)

We can then...

## Setup tests
Create a new Unit Test Case
`File>New>File...`

![newtest.png](Images/newtest.png)

I called my file `TestList` and saved as usual.


Here is my sample test:
```swift
class TestList: FBSnapshotTestCase {
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        recordMode = true
    }

    func testList() {
        let networkManager = MockNetworkManager(session: URLSession.shared)
        networkManager.outputData = photoString.data(using: .utf8)
        let listVM = ListViewModel(manager: networkManager)
        let list = ListViewController(viewModel: listVM)
        FBSnapshotVerifyViewController(list)
    }

}
```

We get an error!

```swift
failed - Test ran in record mode. Reference image is now saved. Disable record mode to perform an actual snapshot comparison!
```

Oh dear!

But it isn't as bad as it might seem - reference images have been added in a rather fantastic folder! 

![ReferenceImages.png](Images/ReferenceImages.png)

So to check against this reference image, we *remove* the recodeMode!

```swift
class TestList: FBSnapshotTestCase {
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        recordMode = false
    }

    func testList() {
        let networkManager = MockNetworkManager(session: URLSession.shared)
        networkManager.outputData = photoString.data(using: .utf8)
        let listVM = ListViewModel(manager: networkManager)
        let list = ListViewController(viewModel: listVM)
        FBSnapshotVerifyViewController(list)
    }

}
```
which will match, but if we now change the code to pull in `emptyString`:

```swift
class TestList: FBSnapshotTestCase {
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        recordMode = false
    }

    func testList() {
        let networkManager = MockNetworkManager(session: URLSession.shared)
        networkManager.outputData = emptyString.data(using: .utf8)
        let listVM = ListViewModel(manager: networkManager)
        let list = ListViewController(viewModel: listVM)
        FBSnapshotVerifyViewController(list)
    }

}
```

The code even "notices" if I change just one character in the screenshot.

you are even provided with diff images! 
![failurediff.png](failurediff.png)

What happens if you change device, though? Of course the test will fail!


# Conclusion
This is quite automatic - you just need to decide when to record the screenshots.

Your test team will thank you - they can just go through your screenshots and check if they are correct - fantastic!

Who else will thank you? You will thank you when you find those bugs that are hiding in your code!
