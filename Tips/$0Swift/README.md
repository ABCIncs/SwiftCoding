# STOP Using $0 as a Shorthand Parameter in Swift
## You need readable code!

If you are using closures in your Swift code, you may become familiar with the shorthand parameter syntax. That is, parameter names are often represented as `$0` or `$1`.

You may or may not be aware that these continue, in that for each parameter the shorthand name is incremented by one each time (`$2` and `$3` up to the number of arguments as is required in your code).

## Why you should use shorthand parameters
Rather than making your code easier to read, you have developed code that obstruficates the meaning. That is, you have so many shorthand parameters that you are not sure which to choose.

## Why you should stop using shorthand parameters
Rather than making your code easier to read, you have so many shorthand parameters that you are not sure which to choose

## So rather than stopping using $0, you are saying it depends?
Exactly!

Common functions like `sort` are a commonly used in Swift. You can expect to use shorthand parameters in conjunction with sort closures, and others. Frequently when used with those closures shorthand arguments (like `$0` ) do not detrimentally affect readability. There is even an argument that readability is increased by using shorthand parameters!

However, a line with several functions and repeated shorthand parameters (like `$0` repeated) cannot be said to be easy to read in some circumstances (more on that later).

We need to weigh up:
 - readability through brevity
 against
 - readability through clarity

If you are not in a position to decide between that readability criteria there is one important thing you can do to improve the quality of your code.Â 

Sleep on your code, and come back the next day and see it with fresh eyes.

Alternatively use [rubber duck debugging](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/rubber-duck-debugging-298349134056).

## Can we have some common examples of these shorthand arguments?
Of course you can!

Sorting is one of the common usages of shorthand arguments. Perhaps you want to sort a list (array) of names in alphabetical order?

```swift
let names = ["Tom", "Ahmed", "Karen"]
let ascendingNames = names.sorted(by: { $0 < $1 })
```
`$0` and `$1` represent names and the order that the names should be sorted in. In the case of the example above the order is ascending (<).

Another example is mapping, which can considered to be slightly more complex. The following code snippet is intended to represent a viewModel that might make an API call (not in the code snippet) and returns a list of loggedInUsers. This could potentially be printed in a ViewController by calling a completion handler (shown here with the line `viewModel.completion!(loggedInUsers)`).

```swift
struct Users {
    let data: [Data]
    struct Data {
        let firstName: String
        let secondName: String
        let email: String
    }
}

let loggedInUsers = Users(data: [Users.Data(firstName: "Dave", secondName: "Roberts", email: "dave@loggedin"), Users.Data(firstName: "Latasha", secondName: "Wilson", email: "latasha@loggedin")])


class ViewModel {
    var completion: ((Users) -> Void)?
    var complexCompletion: ((Users, Users) -> Void)?
}

let viewModel = ViewModel()

viewModel.completion = {
    print($0.data.map{ "\($0.firstName) \($0.secondName): \($0.email)" }.joined(separator: "\n"))
}

viewModel.completion!(loggedInUsers)
```

this gives the following output:

```swift
Dave Roberts: dave@loggedin
Latasha Wilson: latasha@loggedin
```

When you begin to look at this closure you can see the type of issue the frequently can arise. `$0` Represents more than one thing in one line (for reference, there is an image below). Now whether you think that is acceptable or not depends on you, and what is acceptable for your team. *It is down to you to decide what code is acceptable.*

That is: It depends!

# Conclusion
Another "it depends" answer? Is that acceptable in a blog article?

Well, unfortunately this is coding. In the case of thinking through solutions there are no solutions that apply to all situations.

You're going to have to make your own decisions. Sorry.

I hope this article has gone some way to explain the potential issues that might occur when using shorthand arguments, explaining what they are and tradeoffs that might change the way you think about your code.
