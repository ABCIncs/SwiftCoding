This article has been developed using Xcode 11.4.1, and Swift 5.2.2

## Prerequisites:
* You will be expected to be aware how to make a [Single View Application](https://medium.com/swlh/your-first-ios-application-using-xcode-9983cf6efb71), or a [Playground](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/coding-in-swift-playgrounds-1a5563efa089) to run Swift code

## Terminology:
keypath: Read-only access to a property
writablekeypath: read-write access to a value-type property
referencewritablekeypath: read-write access to a reference-type property

# Motivation
`Combine` uses `ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Root, Bool>` in the assign function

```swift
func assign<Root>(to keyPath: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Root, Bool>, on object: Root) -> AnyCancellable
```

which is the one that allows us to connect to `UIKit` elements, for example

```swift
validationSub = loginViewModel?.userValidation
    .receive(on: RunLoop.main)
    .assign(to: \.isEnabled, on: loginView.loginButton)
```

That seems fine, but what are keypaths? How are they used, and what do they mean?

Could you make an article explaining this for me?

I don't mind if I do!

## What is a keypath?
A keypath provides read-only access to a property, whilst a writable keypath provides (well...) writable access to a property.

## A keypath example
Perhaps the best way to describe this access is through an example, where we can set up a rather basic `struct` object.

```swift
struct Person {
    var firstname: String
    var secondname: String
    var age: Int
}
let dave = Person(firstname: "Dave", secondname: "Trencher" , age: 21)
```

we can then access the properties through `WritableKeyPath<Person, String>` or `WritableKeyPath<Person, Int>` (where firstname and secondname are represented by a `String` and age is represeted by a `Int`).

The following keypath therefore returns a `String`, and that can be printed out

```swift
let firstname: String = dave[keyPath: \Person.firstname]
print (firstname) // Dave
```

Now even the property type can be stored

```swift
var writableKeyPathFirstName: WritableKeyPath<Person, String> = \Person.firstname
print (dave[keyPath: writableKeyPathFirstName]) // Dave
```

which means that you can potentially use the same property in multiple places, and storing it as a property itself means that it would only need to be stored in one place.

## Nested properties
The following is an example of nested keypaths

``` swift
struct Socks {
    var sockname: String
}

struct DrawContents {
    var name: String
    var socks: Socks
}

let topdrawer = DrawContents(name: "top", socks: Socks(sockname: "Birthday Socks"))
print (topdrawer)
print (topdrawer[keyPath: \DrawContents.name]) // top
print (topdrawer[keyPath: \DrawContents.socks.sockname]) // Birthday Socks
```

## KeyPath composition
Swift allows you to dynamically combine keypaths at runtime (of course the types need to be compatible).
```swift
let topdrawerkpath = \DrawContents.socks
let sockspath = \Socks.sockname
let composedPath: WritableKeyPath<DrawContents, String> = topdrawerkpath.appending(path: sockspath)
```

## KeyPaths as type-erased variants
You may wish to have a keypath that does not require the Value parameter

```swift
let drawerName: PartialKeyPath<DrawContents> = \.name
let drawerSocks: PartialKeyPath<DrawContents> = \.socks
```

So both `drawerName` and `drawerSocks` can be stored with the same type: `PartialKeyPath<DrawContents>`. The `Value` parameter has been type-erased.

## KeyPaths of reference types
This shouldn't be a too big surprise, but if you use a keypath on a reference type (for example a `class` )

```swift
let horse = Animal(name: "Keith")
var refKeyPath: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Animal, String> = \Animal.name
let animalname: String = horse[keyPath: \Animal.name] // Keith
```

# Are keypaths new?
Keypaths have been around for some time, they're present in `Objective-C`!  However, they were not type safe (`keyPath()` is actually a `String`).
```swift
#keyPath(Person.firstname)
```

# Limitations
`Key path cannot refer to static member 'lifeform'`

If we change `Person` to have a static var. 
```swift
struct Person {
    static var lifeform = "Carbon"
    var firstname: String
    var secondname: String
    var age: Int
}

dave[keyPath: \Person.lifeform] // Key path cannot refer to static member 'lifeform'
```

As, well, keypaths cannot refer to static members! What a shame!

## Conclusion
So, keypaths are actually useful in iOS development, being relevant for `Combine` and SwiftUI. You want to buckle up and become familiar with this, or not? I'd say that the former is more important - and you can read up on this [HERE](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/combine-and-urlsession-in-uikit-68f1caa40ee1).

I hope that this article has helped you out in become more familar in this relatively new feature of Swift.
